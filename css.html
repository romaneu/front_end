            <h2 id="basics">CSS Basics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.</li>
                    <li>CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.</li>
                    <li>Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.</li>
                    <li>Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.</li>
                    <li>IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.</li>
                    <li>Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.</li>
                    <li>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</li>
                    <li>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2 id="b">CSS Visual Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.</li>
                    <li>The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.</li>
                    <li>font-size controls the size of text displayed.</li>
                    <li>font-weight defines how thin or thick text is displayed.</li>
                    <li>The text-align property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.</li>
                    <li>Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.</li>
                    <li>CSS can make an element transparent with the opacity property.</li>
                    <li>CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the background-image property.</li>
                    <li>The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2 id="c">CSS color </h2>
                <p>There are four ways to represent color in CSS:</p>
                <ol>    
                    <li>Named colors — there are 147 named colors</li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal or hex colors</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”.</li>
                            <li>Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green using hexademical numbers such as #23F41A.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>RGB</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.</li>
                            <li>RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>HSL</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).</li>
                            <li>Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                    <p>You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a, which is represented as a percentage.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="d">Typography</h2>
                <p>When setting typefaces on a web page, keep the following points in mind:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user’s computer in order for that font to display when a user visit the web page. We’ll learn how to work around this issue in a later exercise.</li>
                        <li>It’s a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3.</li>
                        <li>When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized).</li>
                    </ol>
                <p><strong>Fonts:</strong>When using numeric weights, there are a number of default font weights that we can use:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>400 is the default font-weight of most text.</li>
                        <li>700 signifies a bold font-weight.</li>
                        <li>300 signifies a light font-weight.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p><strong>Word spacing:</strong> You can also increase the spacing between words in a body of text, technically known as word spacing. To do so, you can use the word-spacing property.</p>
                <p><strong>Letter Spacing:</strong>The technical term for adjusting the spacing between letters is called tracking. Tracking can be adjusted with the letter-spacing property in CSS.</p>
                <p><strong>Text Transformation:</strong>Text can also be styled to appear in either all uppercase or lowercase with the text-transform property.</p>
                <p><strong>Text Alignment:</strong>No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser. To move, or align, text, we can use the text-align property.</p>
                <p><strong>Fallback Fonts:</strong>Most computers have a small set of typefaces pre-installed. This small set includes serif fonts like Times New Roman and sans-serif fonts like Arial. These pre-installed fonts serve as fallback fonts if the stylesheet specifies a font which is not installed on a user’s computer.</p>
                <p><strong>Linking fonts</strong>With the number of fonts available with modern typography, it is unrealistic to expect users to have all fonts installed on their computers. New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to these fonts as non-user fonts. When we have the link to the font and the styles of our choice, we can add the font to the "head" section of the HTML document, using the "link" tag and the href property.</p>
                <p> CSS offers a way to import fonts directly into stylesheets with the @font-face property. To load fonts with the @font-face property:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Instead of using the font’s link in the HTML document, enter the link into the URL bar in the browser.</li>
                        <li>The browser will load the CSS rules. You will need to focus on the rules that are directly labeled as /* latin */. Some of the latin rules are on separate lines. You will need each of these.</li>
                        <li>Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin, and paste the rules from the browser to the top of style.css.</li>
                    </ol>
                    It is important to stress the need to copy the @font-face rules to the top of the stylesheet for the font to load correctly in the project.
                </p>
            <h2 id="e">Box Model</h2>
                <P>All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as “living” inside of a box. This is what is meant by the box model. The box model comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page. The model includes the content area’s size (width and height) and the element’s padding, border, and margin. The properties include:</P>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Width and height — specifies the width and height of the content area.</li>
                        <li>Padding — specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.</li>
                        <li>Border — specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.</li>
                        <li>Margin — specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="/Users/yossel/Desktop/coding/Yossel´s Front End- journey/resouces /images/BoxModel.png" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" alt="BoxModel">
                <p><strong>Height and Width:</strong>An element’s content has two dimensions: a height and a width. By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.</p>
                <p><strong>Borders:</strong>A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>width — The thickness of the border. A border’s thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.</li>
                        <li>style — The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style#Values">10 different styles</a>. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and solid.</li>
                        <li>color — The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">140 built-in color keywords.</a></li>
                    </ol>
                <p>The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of the element. If width, style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns the default value for that property.</p>
                <p><strong>Border Radius:</strong>You can modify the corners of an element’s border box with the border-radius property. You can create a border that is a perfect circle by first creating an element with the same width and height and then setting the radius equal to the distance between the center of the circle and the width of the box, which is 50%.</p>
                <p><strong>Padding:</strong>The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it. In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.</p>
                <p>If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box’s content, you can use the following properties:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>padding-top</li>
                        <li>padding-right</li>
                        <li>padding-bottom</li>
                        <li>padding-left</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Another implementation of the padding property lets you specify exactly how much padding there should be on each side of the content in a single declaration. Example: "padding:6px 11px 4px 9px;" In the example, the four values 6px 11px 4px 9px correspond to the amount of padding in a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the amount of padding on the top (6 pixels), right (11 pixels), bottom (4 pixels), and left (9 pixels) sides of the content.</p>
                <p>However, if the top and bottom values for padding will equal each other, and the left and right values for padding will also equal each other, you can use the following shortcut: "padding: 5px 10px;" The first value, 5px, sets the padding value for the top and bottom sides of the content. The second value, 10px, sets the padding value for the left and right sides of the content.</p>
